## Workflow Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline automates key aspects of development, testing, and release processes using 5 core workflows tailored for academic research environments.

| Workflow              | File                    | Purpose                               | Triggers                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Main CI               | `ci.yml`                | Code quality, testing, security       | Push/PR to main/develop  |
| Release               | `release.yml`           | Automated dual releases               | Version tags, manual     |
| Dependency Security   | `dependency-check.yml`  | Security audits, compliance           | Manual trigger           |
| Automated Updates     | `dependency-update.yml` | Dependency management                 | Manual trigger           |
| Auto-Assignment       | `auto-assign.yml`       | PR/issue automation                   | PR/issue events          |

Key workflow automation achievements include a 30-50% build time reduction via intelligent caching and a 95%+ success rate on automated dependency updates.

## CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline is designed with a focus on academic research needs, emphasizing simplicity, privacy, cost-effectiveness, educational value, and reproducibility. This philosophy is further detailed in the [Design Exclusions](#design-exclusions) section.

### Main CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose:** Ensures code quality, performs comprehensive testing across multiple platforms and Python versions, and conducts security scans.
**Triggers:** Push to `main`/`develop`, Pull Requests to `main`/`develop`, manual dispatch.
**Key Outcomes/Artifacts:** Linting reports, HTML coverage reports, Bandit security analysis (JSON), API documentation.
**Details:** Refer to `ci.yml` for specific jobs including code quality checks (Black, isort, flake8, pylint, mypy), the 15-combination test matrix (3 OS × 5 Python versions) using pytest, security scanning with Bandit, integration tests, and documentation generation.

### Release Automation (`release.yml`)

**Purpose:** Automates the creation of dual releases: a full pipeline release for developers and a data-only release for researchers.
**Triggers:** Version tags (e.g., `v*`), manual dispatch.
**Key Outcomes/Artifacts:** Full pipeline archives (`china-data-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`, `.zip`), data-only archives (`china-data-only-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz`, `.zip`), GitHub release with changelog and version manifest.
**Details:** See `release.yml` for the process involving validation, testing, building, changelog generation, and publishing. Special features include branch protection and public accessibility for data-only releases.

### Security Management (`dependency-check.yml`)

**Purpose:** Provides on-demand comprehensive security auditing of dependencies and license compliance.
**Triggers:** Manual dispatch.
**Key Outcomes/Artifacts:** Security audit reports (Bandit, dependency tree), license compliance reports, dependency update reports with security context, security advisory summaries.
**Details:** Consult `dependency-check.yml` for jobs covering dependency audits, license compliance checks against problematic categories, cross-version compatibility testing, and update monitoring.

### Automated Updates (`dependency-update.yml`)

**Purpose:** Manages dependencies intelligently through a configurable update system.
**Triggers:** Manual dispatch with inputs for `update_type` (patch, minor, major) and `target_python`.
**Key Outcomes/Artifacts:** Automated Pull Requests with `requirements.txt` updates, detailed update summaries, security risk assessments.
**Details:** The `dependency-update.yml` file outlines the process of update analysis, multi-platform validation (15 combinations), intelligent PR creation, and failure recovery.

### Auto-Assignment (`auto-assign.yml`)

**Purpose:** Streamlines project management by automating PR/issue assignments and labeling.
**Triggers:** Pull Request `opened`, `ready_for_review`, `reopened`; Issue `opened`.
**Key Outcomes:** Automatic assignment of PRs/issues to maintainers, intelligent labeling based on changed files, PR size classification.
**Details:** Configuration for this workflow is managed in `.github/auto-assign-config.yml` (assignment rules), `.github/labeler.yml` (labeling rules), and `.github/CODEOWNERS` (code ownership). Refer to `auto-assign.yml` for the workflow logic.

---

## Security and Quality Framework

### Security-First Approach

Our workflows employ multi-layered security, including scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions, vulnerability scanning (Bandit for static analysis, dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities), and license compliance monitoring for problematic license categories.

### Quality Metrics and Monitoring

Workflow performance and reliability are key metrics. We monitor build success rates, average build times, cache hit rates, and the success of automated processes like dependency updates. General code quality metrics (coverage, linting) are enforced by the CI pipeline and detailed in the main project `README.md`.

**Quality Enforcement Mechanisms:**

- CI pipeline enforces coverage thresholds (typically >80%).
- Workflows may be blocked by security gate failures.
- Code style is validated, and multi-platform compatibility is ensured.

---

## Design Exclusions

Our CI/CD pipeline intentionally excludes features common in enterprise settings that are less suitable or counterproductive for academic research. This design prioritizes simplicity, privacy, resource conservation, and educational value.

- **No Scheduled/Cron Triggers:** Research data processing is deliberate; avoids API rate limit issues and conserves resources.
- **No External Security Services:** Leverages built-in tools (Bandit, dependency scanning) to maintain data privacy and manage costs.
- **No Performance Benchmarking Workflows:** Focuses on correctness and reproducibility over micro-optimizations, as data processing performance is data-dependent.
- **No Container/Deployment Workflows:** Python virtual environments offer sufficient isolation; avoids container complexity for researchers.
- **No External Notification/Integration Services:** GitHub notifications are adequate; maintains privacy and avoids external service dependencies.
- **No Database Migration/Schema Workflows:** Project uses file-based processing, aligning with researcher accessibility.
- **No Multi-Environment Deployment Pipelines:** Academic data processing typically occurs in a single local environment.
- **No External Code Quality Services:** Relies on integrated tools (Black, flake8, pylint, mypy) for comprehensive analysis within budget and privacy constraints.

This philosophy ensures the CI/CD pipeline effectively supports academic research needs.

## Workflow Details

### Required Secrets and Configuration

- **Essential Secrets:** All workflows primarily use the automatically provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`. No additional secrets are strictly required for core functionality.
- **Optional Enhancements:** For enhanced coverage reporting with Codecov, a `CODECOV_TOKEN` can be added as a repository secret (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions). See GitHub documentation for adding secrets.
- **Repository Configuration Files:**
  - `.github/auto-assign-config.yml`: Governs auto-assignment rules.
  - `.github/labeler.yml`: Defines file-based labeling rules.
  - `.github/CODEOWNERS`: Specifies code ownership.

### Workflow Triggers and Optimization

Workflows are triggered by various events (push, PR, tags, manual dispatch). Optimizations include conditional execution based on file changes, branch filtering, path-based filtering to reduce unnecessary runs, and smart dependency caching. Refer to individual workflow YAML files for specific trigger configurations.

---

## Performance Optimization

Workflows are optimized for performance, achieving 30-50% faster builds primarily through:

- **Advanced Caching Strategy:** Multi-level dependency caching (pip cache, site-packages) is implemented, keyed by OS, Python version, and requirement file hashes. This reduces build times and bandwidth usage. For specifics, see the `actions/cache@v4` steps in workflow YAML files.
- **Matrix Optimization Strategy:** Test matrices are designed for a balance of comprehensive testing and efficiency. Critical tests run on a full matrix (e.g., 15 OS/Python combinations), while other jobs like code quality may run on a single platform.
- **Parallel Job Execution:** Jobs are run in parallel where dependencies allow.
- **Resource Optimization:** Includes fail-fast disabled for complete feedback, strategic job ordering, efficient artifact management, and use of environment variables like `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` and `PIP_CACHE_DIR`.

---

## Configuration and Setup

### Branch Protection

It is highly recommended to configure branch protection rules for `main` and `develop` branches in repository settings. Key rules include requiring status checks to pass (e.g., "Code Quality", "Test Suite", "Security Scan"), requiring PRs, and requiring review approvals.

### Labeling and Assignment

PR/issue labeling and assignment are automated by `auto-assign.yml` and configured via:

- `.github/auto-assign-config.yml`: Defines reviewer/assignee selection logic.
- `.github/labeler.yml`: Contains rules for applying labels based on changed file paths.
Refer to these files for their current configuration.

### Status Badge Integration

Status badges for CI, performance tests, dependency checks, and code coverage are included in the main project `README.md`, providing real-time visibility into workflow health and project quality.

---

## Troubleshooting

General strategies for troubleshooting workflow issues:

- **Examine Workflow Logs:** GitHub Actions provide detailed logs for each step.
- **Download Artifacts:** Failed runs often produce artifacts (test reports, scan results) that can be analyzed locally.
- **Enable Debug Logging:** Set `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true` or `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true` as environment variables in the workflow file for more verbose output.
- **Reproduce Locally:** Attempt to reproduce failures in a local environment matching the CI setup (OS, Python version, dependencies). Refer to the main project `README.md` or development guides for local testing commands.
- **Check `job` and `step` conditions:** Ensure that `if` conditions in workflows are evaluating as expected.

For performance issues, review cache hit rates in logs and analyze job execution times. For specific tool errors (e.g., pytest, Bandit), consult their respective documentation.

### Emergency Procedures

- **Workflow Failures Blocking Development:** Assess criticality. If necessary, temporarily disable problematic jobs/workflows or use manual overrides while investigating. Conduct a post-incident review.
- **Security Vulnerability Detection:** Assess severity. Prioritize updating vulnerable dependencies and validate changes thoroughly.

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Maintenance Areas

Ongoing maintenance includes:

- Reviewing security scan results and dependency advisories.
- Monitoring workflow performance metrics (build times, success rates, cache effectiveness).
- Periodically updating GitHub Actions versions and other dependencies used in workflows.
- Keeping this workflow documentation and related configuration files current.
- Analyzing failed workflow runs to identify and resolve recurring issues.

### Performance and Health Monitoring

Workflow health and performance are monitored via:

- **GitHub Actions Dashboard:** For real-time status and history.
- **Status Badges:** In the main `README.md`.
- **Artifact Analysis:** From workflow runs.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) include build success rates (target >95%), average build times, and cache hit rates (target >80%).

### Continuous Improvement

We follow a cycle of measuring baseline performance, implementing optimizations, assessing impact, and updating documentation to continuously enhance workflow efficiency and security.
