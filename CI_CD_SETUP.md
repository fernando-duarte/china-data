## Usage Guide

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

# Run the full test suite
make test

# Run code quality checks
make lint
make format

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/data_integrity/ -v
pytest tests/processor/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Creating a Release

**üîí Important: Releases must be created from the `main` branch only!**

1. **Switch to main branch and prepare:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're on main branch  
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   
   # Ensure all tests pass
   make test
   
   # Update version in relevant files and commit
   git commit -m "Prepare release v1.0.0"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create and push tag FROM MAIN:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Monitor the release workflow:**
   - ‚úÖ Validates tag is from main branch
   - ‚úÖ Runs full test suite and code quality checks
   - ‚úÖ Creates both full and data-only releases
   - ‚úÖ Generates automatic changelog from commits
   - ‚úÖ Publishes to GitHub Releases with comprehensive documentation

### **‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens if You Tag From Wrong Branch**

```bash
# ‚ùå This will FAIL:
git checkout feature-branch
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0

# Error message:
# "Release tags must be created from main/master branch"
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Create .pre-commit-config.yaml
cat > .pre-commit-config.yaml << EOF
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 25.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        args: [--line-length=120]
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: 5.13.2
    hooks:
      - id: isort
        args: [--profile=black, --line-length=120]
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 6.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
EOF

# Install hooks
pre-commit install
```

### IDE Integration

Configure your IDE to use the same tools:
- **Black** for formatting (120-character line limit)
- **isort** for import sorting (black-compatible profile)
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

This ensures consistency between local development and CI.

## Advanced Features

### 1. Intelligent Caching System

The workflows implement sophisticated caching:
```yaml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cache/pip
      ~/.local/lib/python*/site-packages
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-python-${{ matrix.python-version }}-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements*.txt') }}
```

**Benefits:**
- 30-50% reduction in build time
- Intelligent cache invalidation
- Cross-platform cache optimization

### 2. Security-First Approach

**Multi-layer security implementation:**
- **Proper permissions scoping** for all workflows
- **Comprehensive vulnerability scanning** with Bandit
- **License compliance monitoring** with automated detection

- **üìä Policy Analysis:** Government and NGO researchers can access current data
- **üì∞ Journalism:** Economic reporters can download latest indicators
- **üî¨ Reproducible Research:** Stable URLs ensure long-term accessibility

### **üìñ Citation Guidelines**

When using the public data releases, users should cite:
1. **Original data sources** (World Bank WDI, Penn World Table, IMF)
2. **This processed dataset** with version and release date
3. **DOI or GitHub release URL** for reproducibility

## ‚ùå What This Codebase Should NOT Have

### **Important Design Decisions - Excluded Features**

This CI/CD implementation intentionally **excludes** certain common GitHub Actions workflows and features that are not appropriate for this academic data processing pipeline:

#### **üö´ No Scheduled/Cron Triggers**
```yaml
# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED - No automatic scheduled workflows
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily runs
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Weekly runs
```

**Why excluded:**
- **Academic timeline:** Research data processing should be intentional, not automatic
- **Data source dependencies:** External APIs (World Bank, IMF) may have rate limits
- **Resource conservation:** Avoid unnecessary compute usage for unchanged data
- **Version control:** Manual releases ensure proper versioning and documentation
- **Cost control:** Prevents unexpected GitHub Actions minutes consumption

#### **üö´ No External Security Service Integrations**
```yaml
# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED - No third-party security services
- name: Snyk Security Scan
  uses: snyk/actions/python@master
  
- name: SonarQube Analysis  
  uses: sonarqube-quality-gate-action@master
  
- name: Veracode Security Scan
  uses: veracode/veracode-uploadandscan-action@master
```

**Why excluded:**
- **Academic budget constraints:** External services often require paid subscriptions
- **Privacy concerns:** Sensitive economic data should not be sent to third-party services
- **Sufficient built-in security:** Bandit and dependency scanning provide adequate security
- **Academic access limitations:** Many external services require enterprise accounts
- **Data sovereignty:** Research data should remain within institutional control

#### **üö´ No Performance Benchmarking Workflows**
```yaml
# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED - No performance regression testing
- name: Performance Benchmarks
  run: pytest --benchmark-only --benchmark-compare
  
- name: Memory Profiling
  run: python -m memory_profiler china_data_processor.py
  
- name: Load Testing
  uses: loadimpact/k6-action@v0.2.0
```

**Why excluded:**
- **Data processing nature:** Performance is data-dependent, not code-dependent
- **Academic priorities:** Correctness and reproducibility matter more than optimization
- **Resource intensity:** Benchmarking workflows consume significant compute resources
- **Limited utility:** Economic data processing doesn't require millisecond optimization
- **Complexity overhead:** Performance testing adds complexity without academic value

#### **üö´ No Container/Docker Workflows**
```yaml
# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED - No container building or deployment
- name: Build Docker Image
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
  
- name: Deploy to Container Registry
  uses: docker/login-action@v2
```

**Why excluded:**
- **Python environment sufficiency:** Virtual environments provide adequate isolation
- **Academic simplicity:** Researchers prefer straightforward Python setup
- **Resource requirements:** Container workflows require additional infrastructure
- **Deployment unnecessary:** This is a data processing tool, not a deployed service
- **Learning curve:** Containers add complexity for academic users

#### **üö´ No Deployment/Infrastructure Workflows**
```yaml
# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED - No deployment automation
- name: Deploy to Production
  uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
  
- name: Infrastructure as Code
  uses: hashicorp/terraform-github-actions@v0.8
  
- name: Kubernetes Deployment
  uses: azure/k8s-deploy@v1
```

**Why excluded:**
- **No deployment target:** Data processing pipeline doesn't require hosted deployment
- **Academic use case:** Researchers run locally or on their own infrastructure
- **Complexity mismatch:** Infrastructure workflows inappropriate for research tools
- **Cost implications:** Cloud deployments involve ongoing costs
- **Security concerns:** Academic data should not be automatically deployed to cloud

#### **üö´ No External Notification Services**
```yaml
# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED - No external messaging integration
- name: Slack Notification
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  
- name: Teams Notification
  uses: skitionek/notify-microsoft-teams@master
  
- name: Discord Notification
  uses: Ilshidur/action-discord@master
```

**Why excluded:**
- **GitHub notifications sufficient:** Built-in email notifications work for academic teams
- **Privacy considerations:** Academic work should not require external messaging services
- **Service dependencies:** External services may become unavailable or change APIs
- **Professional boundaries:** Academic work should use institutional communication channels
- **Additional complexity:** External notifications add configuration overhead

#### **üö´ No Database Migration or Schema Workflows**
```yaml
# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED - No database automation
- name: Database Migration
  run: python manage.py migrate
  
- name: Schema Validation
  uses: liquibase/liquibase-github-action@v7
```

**Why excluded:**
- **File-based data:** Economic data is processed as files, not stored in databases
- **Simplicity preferred:** File-based approach is more accessible to researchers
- **No persistent infrastructure:** Data processing doesn't require database management
- **Academic accessibility:** Researchers can work with CSV/Excel files directly

#### **üö´ No Multi-Environment Deployment Pipelines**
```yaml
# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED - No environment promotion
- name: Deploy to Staging
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  
- name: Deploy to Production  
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  
- name: Smoke Tests
  run: curl -f https://staging.example.com/health
```

**Why excluded:**
- **Single environment use:** Academic data processing runs in researcher's local environment
- **No staging needed:** Data processing doesn't require staged deployment testing
- **Resource efficiency:** Multiple environments would waste computational resources
- **Academic workflow:** Research follows different patterns than software deployment

#### **üö´ No External Code Quality Services**
```yaml
# ‚ùå NOT INCLUDED - No third-party code analysis
- name: CodeClimate Analysis
  uses: paambaati/codeclimate-action@v3.0.0
  
- name: Codacy Analysis
  uses: codacy/codacy-analysis-cli-action@master
  
- name: DeepCode Analysis
  uses: DeepCodeAI/action@master
```

**Why excluded:**
- **Built-in tools sufficient:** Black, flake8, pylint, mypy provide comprehensive analysis
- **Academic budget:** External services often require paid subscriptions
- **Data privacy:** Academic code should not be sent to third-party analysis services
- **Tool proliferation:** Too many tools create notification fatigue
- **Educational value:** Researchers learn more from direct tool feedback

### **üéØ Design Philosophy**

This CI/CD implementation follows **academic research principles**:

1. **Simplicity over complexity** - Easy for researchers to understand and modify
2. **Privacy-first** - No external services that could access research data
3. **Cost-conscious** - Minimal resource usage appropriate for academic budgets
4. **Educational** - Uses standard tools that teach transferable skills
5. **Reproducible** - Focus on correctness and documentation over optimization
6. **Accessible** - Works in typical academic computing environments

### **‚úÖ What We DO Include (By Design)**

- **Manual triggers** instead of automatic scheduling
- **Built-in security tools** instead of external services
- **File-based processing** instead of database complexity
- **Local development focus** instead of cloud deployment
- **GitHub-native features** instead of external integrations
- **Educational tools** that researchers can understand and learn from

This approach ensures the CI/CD pipeline serves the **specific needs of academic research** rather than following generic software development patterns that may be inappropriate for this use case.
