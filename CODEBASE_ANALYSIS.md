# Codebase Analysis

This document summarizes the structure and functionality of the **china-data** repository. A `CODEBASE_REVIEW.md` file was not found, so this analysis is based on the repository contents.

## Overview

The project provides tools to collect, process and analyze economic data for China from multiple sources. According to the README:

> China Economic Data Analysis
> 
> This package contains scripts to download, process, and analyze economic data for China from multiple sources including the World Bank, Penn World Table, and IMF Fiscal Monitor. It provides tools for data retrieval, processing, analysis, and projection of economic indicators.

## Installation and Setup

The typical workflow is handled by the `setup.sh` script which performs dependency installation and runs the data pipeline:

```
./setup.sh
```

The script creates a virtual environment, installs required packages, runs the downloader and processor, and stores results in the `output` directory. Several command‑line options allow custom parameters (e.g., capital share, capital‑output ratio, output name, end year).

## Repository Structure

The README lists the key directories and files:

## Key Modules

- **china_data_downloader.py** – Downloads data from World Bank, Penn World Table, and IMF. Output is a markdown table (`china_data_raw.md`).
- **china_data_processor.py** – Converts units, calculates capital stock, projects human capital, extrapolates series using ARIMA or linear regression, computes derived indicators (e.g., TFP, savings), and writes processed results.
- **utils/** – Collection of helper modules including data source loaders, extrapolation methods, output formatting, and general utilities for path management.
- **tests/** – Pytest suite covering downloader functions, processing utilities, dataframe operations, and a set of data integrity tests validating structure, consistency, and value ranges of the generated data.
- **SECURITY.md** – Describes security improvements such as removing `sys.path` manipulations in tests and enforcing SSL verification for downloads.

## Data Sources and Output

Pre-downloaded IMF data lives in `input/`. Processed and raw outputs are written to the `output/` directory. The parameters_info directory contains additional documentation on key parameters used in the computations.

## Conclusion

The repository is organized as a small data processing pipeline with clear separation of data download, processing logic, and supporting utilities. Extensive tests ensure data integrity and verify individual processing functions.
