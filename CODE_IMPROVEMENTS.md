- **Standardize version targets** across all configuration files âœ…
- **Update CI matrix** to remove Python 3.8 testing âœ…

**Implementation Details:**

- Updated `pyproject.toml`: Black target-version, Pylint py-version, MyPy python_version
- Updated `ruff.toml`: target-version set to py39
- Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: default_language_version set to python3.9
- Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Python version check updated to 3.9+
- Updated `PRE_COMMIT_BEST_PRACTICES.md`: Documentation updated
- Added `[project]` section to `pyproject.toml` with `requires-python = ">=3.9"`

### 2. Type Checking Enhancements âœ… COMPLETED

- **Enable strict mypy mode** with comprehensive type checking âœ…
- **Add missing type hints** to all function parameters and return values âœ…
- **Remove mypy ignores** and fix underlying type issues âœ…
- **Add type checking for test files** âœ…

**Implementation Details:**

- Updated all union syntax from `X | Y` to `Union[X, Y]` for Python 3.9 compatibility
- Added comprehensive type imports (`Optional`, `Dict`, `List`, `Tuple`, `Union`) throughout codebase
- Enhanced mypy configuration with strict mode and additional checks
- Added targeted overrides for test files and decorator modules to reduce noise
- Fixed all type annotation issues in core modules
- Achieved 100% mypy compliance with 0 errors across 77 source files

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Improvements

### 3. Dependency Management Modernization âœ… COMPLETED

- **Migrate to `uv`** for faster dependency resolution âœ…
- **Add dependency vulnerability scanning** in CI/CD pipeline âœ…
- **Pin dependency versions** more precisely with upper bounds âœ…

**Implementation Details:**

- Added uv configuration to `pyproject.toml` with workspace and dependency resolution settings
- Updated `setup.sh` to support `--uv` flag for faster dependency resolution with backward compatibility
- Added upper bounds to all dependencies in `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt`
- Migrated dependencies to `pyproject.toml` with `[project.dependencies]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]`
- Created comprehensive vulnerability scanning workflow (`.github/workflows/vulnerability-scan.yml`)
- Enhanced existing dependency-check workflow with pip-audit and safety scanning
- Added automated vulnerability issue creation and PR comments
- Added SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab for vulnerability tracking
- Added Makefile targets for uv installation and security scanning
- Updated README.md with dependency management documentation
- Added `.uv-cache/` to `.gitignore` for uv cache directory
- Intentionally excluded daily scheduled scans to prevent alert fatigue and align with academic research workflow philosophy

### 4. Security Enhancements

- **Add SAST scanning** with Semgrep Community Edition (free)
- **Implement supply chain security** with step-security/harden-runner (free for public repos)
- **Add SBOM generation** for dependency tracking with syft (free)
- **Enable GitHub security advisories** integration
- **Add secrets scanning** for commit history
- **Implement vulnerability scanning** with pip-audit (already installed)
- **Add security policy as code** with automated compliance checks
- **Enable dependency update automation** with security-focused bot integration

### 5. Testing Infrastructure Improvements CODEX

- **Add property-based testing** with Hypothesis
- **Implement mutation testing** with mutmut
- **Add test data factories** with factory_boy

### 6. Code Quality Enhancements âœ… COMPLETED

- **Enable additional Ruff rules** (currently ignoring some D, ANN rules) âœ…
- **Add complexity analysis** with radon âœ…
- **Add docstring coverage checking** with interrogate âœ…
- **Enable import sorting validation** in pre-commit âœ…

**Implementation Details:**

- Enabled additional Ruff rules by removing some D and ANN ignores from `ruff.toml`
- Added `radon>=6.0,<7.0` and `interrogate>=1.7,<2.0` to `dev-requirements.txt`
- Added radon complexity checking and interrogate docstring coverage hooks to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Added interrogate configuration to `pyproject.toml` with 80% coverage threshold
- Import sorting validation already enabled via Ruff's `I` (isort) rules
- Updated CI skip list to include new local hooks that require system dependencies

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Improvements

### 7. Documentation Modernization

- **Migrate to mkdocs-material** for documentation site
- **Add interactive code examples** with doctest integration
- **Create API documentation** with Sphinx autodoc
- **Add architecture decision records** (ADRs)
- **Implement documentation testing** in CI/CD

### 9. Development Experience Improvements

- **Add VS Code devcontainer** configuration
- **Create development environment** with Docker Compose CODEX done

### 10. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements

- **Add parallel test execution** with pytest-xdist
- **Implement test result caching** for faster CI
