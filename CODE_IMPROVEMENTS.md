## 🔍 Current State Assessment

The project has successfully implemented **8 out of 10 major improvement categories** with
high-quality implementations. The codebase demonstrates:

- **Modern Python practices** with 3.13.3 runtime and 3.9+ compatibility
- **Comprehensive type safety** with strict mypy configuration
- **Production-ready logging** with structured logging and observability
- **Robust CI/CD pipeline** with 8 automated workflows
- **Professional documentation** with MkDocs Material and API autodoc
- **Security-conscious development** with vulnerability scanning and dependency
  management
- **Modern development environment** with VS Code devcontainer following 2025 best
  practices

The remaining gaps are primarily in advanced testing methodologies and additional security
hardening, which are optional for the academic research context of this project.
