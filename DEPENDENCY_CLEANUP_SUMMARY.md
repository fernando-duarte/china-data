# Dependency Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the dependency review and cleanup performed on the China Data project to remove unused
dependencies and optimize the development environment.

## Changes Made

### Production Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

#### ‚úÖ **Kept (Required)**

- `jinja2` - Template rendering for markdown output
- `numpy` - Numerical operations throughout codebase
- `pandas` - Core data manipulation library
- `pandas-datareader` - World Bank data downloads
- `requests` - HTTP requests for data downloads
- `requests-cache` - HTTP caching functionality
- `scikit-learn` - Linear regression in extrapolation methods
- `statsmodels` - ARIMA modeling for time series
- `openpyxl` - Excel file operations (Penn World Table)

#### ‚ùå **Removed (Unused)**

- `tabulate` - Not used anywhere in production code

### Development Dependencies (`dev-requirements.txt`)

#### ‚úÖ **Kept (Essential)**

- `bandit`, `black`, `mypy`, `pylint` - Code quality and security
- `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `pytest-benchmark` - Testing framework
- `pre-commit`, `interrogate`, `radon` - Development workflow
- `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, `mkdocstrings` - Documentation
- `safety`, `semgrep`, `pip-audit` - Security scanning
- `ipython`, `jupyter` - Development utilities
- Type stubs: `pandas-stubs`, `types-pytz`, `types-requests`

#### ‚ùå **Removed (Redundant/Unused)**

- `flake8` - Functionality covered by Ruff
- `isort` - Functionality covered by Ruff's `I` rules
- `sphinx`, `sphinx-autodoc-typehints`, `sphinx-rtd-theme` - Project uses MkDocs
- `requests-cache` - Duplicated from production requirements
- `tabulate` - Not used in production code

### PyProject.toml Updates

Updated both `[project.dependencies]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]` sections to match the cleaned
requirements files. Also updated the UV configuration section.

## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Benefits**

1. **Reduced installation time** - Fewer packages to download and install
2. **Smaller virtual environment** - Less disk space usage
3. **Fewer security vulnerabilities** - Reduced attack surface
4. **Cleaner dependency tree** - Easier to manage and understand
5. **No functionality loss** - All core features preserved

### üîç **Verification**

- All core imports tested successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Documentation build process unaffected (uses MkDocs, not Sphinx)
- Code quality tools still functional (Ruff replaces flake8/isort)

## Recommendations

### Immediate

- Test the full pipeline with cleaned dependencies
- Update CI/CD workflows if needed
- Consider running `pip-audit` to check for vulnerabilities in remaining deps

### Future

- Regularly review dependencies for new unused packages
- Consider using `pipdeptree` to visualize dependency relationships
- Monitor for new security advisories on remaining dependencies

## Tool Consolidation

The cleanup leverages tool consolidation already in place:

- **Ruff** replaces `flake8` and `isort` functionality
- **MkDocs** is used instead of Sphinx for documentation
- **pytest** handles all testing needs

This results in a more streamlined and maintainable development environment.
