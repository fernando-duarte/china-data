# Dependency Management Migration Guide: Dependabot → Renovate (2025)

## 🎯 Why Migrate to Renovate?

### The UV Support Landscape (2025)

- **March 13, 2025**: Dependabot added native UV support
- **2024**: Renovate has had full UV support for over a year
- **Reality**: Renovate offers superior features and UV integration

### Key Advantages of Renovate over Dependabot

| Feature                  | Dependabot      | Renovate        |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| UV `uv.lock` Support     | ✅ (March 2025) | ✅ (Since 2024) |
| Dependency Dashboard     | ❌              | ✅              |
| Intelligent Grouping     | Basic           | Advanced        |
| Monorepo Support         | Limited         | Excellent       |
| Lock File Maintenance    | ❌              | ✅              |
| Security Patch Automerge | Basic           | Advanced        |
| Scheduling Flexibility   | Limited         | Extensive       |
| Platform Support         | GitHub only     | Multi-platform  |

## 🚀 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Install Renovate App

1. Go to [GitHub Apps - Renovate](https://github.com/apps/renovate)
2. Click "Install" and select your repository
3. Grant necessary permissions

### Step 2: Add Renovate Configuration

The `renovate.json5` file has been created with:

- Native UV support with lock file maintenance
- Intelligent dependency grouping
- Security-focused automerge rules
- Proper scheduling and rate limiting

### Step 3: Remove Legacy Dependabot Files

```bash
# Remove Dependabot configuration
rm .github/dependabot.yml

# Remove sync workflow (no longer needed)
rm .github/workflows/sync-requirements.yml

# Remove requirements.txt (optional, but recommended for pure UV workflow)
rm requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Update .gitignore (Optional)

If removing `requirements.txt`, add it to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# No longer needed with Renovate + UV
requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Configuration Highlights

### UV-Specific Features

```json5
{
  // Automatic uv.lock maintenance
  lockFileMaintenance: {
    enabled: true,
    schedule: ["before 6am on monday"],
  },
}
```

### Intelligent Grouping

- **Testing packages**: pytest, hypothesis, factory-boy, syrupy
- **Linting tools**: black, ruff, pylint, mypy, bandit
- **Documentation**: mkdocs packages
- **Security tools**: safety, bandit, semgrep, pip-audit
- **GitHub Actions**: All action updates
- **Docker**: Base image updates

### Security-First Approach

- Vulnerability alerts enabled with immediate scheduling
- Security patches auto-merged
- Major version updates require dashboard approval

## 📊 Expected Improvements

### Before (Dependabot + Workarounds)

- ❌ Required `requirements.txt` sync workflow
- ❌ Limited grouping capabilities
- ❌ No dependency dashboard
- ❌ Manual lock file maintenance
- ❌ Basic security handling

### After (Renovate)

- ✅ Native `uv.lock` support
- ✅ Intelligent dependency grouping
- ✅ Comprehensive dependency dashboard
- ✅ Automatic lock file maintenance
- ✅ Advanced security patch handling
- ✅ Better PR descriptions with changelogs

## 🛡️ Security Benefits

### Enhanced Security Workflow

1. **Immediate Security Updates**: Vulnerabilities patched within hours
2. **Automated Merging**: Security patches auto-merged after CI passes
3. **Comprehensive Scanning**: Covers Python, GitHub Actions, and Docker
4. **Dashboard Overview**: Single view of all security-related updates

### Compliance Improvements

- **SOC 2**: Enhanced automated security controls
- **ISO 27001**: Better systematic security management
- **NIST**: Improved security framework coverage

## 🔄 Migration Timeline

### Immediate (Day 1)

- [x] Install Renovate app
- [x] Add `renovate.json5` configuration
- [x] Test with a small dependency update

### Week 1

- [ ] Remove Dependabot configuration
- [ ] Remove sync workflow
- [ ] Monitor Renovate dashboard

### Week 2

- [ ] Fine-tune grouping rules if needed
- [ ] Adjust scheduling based on team preferences
- [ ] Remove `requirements.txt` if desired

## 🎛️ Customization Options

### Adjust Scheduling

```json5
{
  schedule: ["before 6am on monday"], // Weekly
  // or
  schedule: ["at any time"], // Immediate
}
```

### Modify Grouping

```json5
{
  packageRules: [
    {
      groupName: "Custom group name",
      matchPackagePatterns: ["^your-pattern"],
      schedule: ["before 6am on monday"],
    },
  ],
}
```

### Enable/Disable Automerge

```json5
{
  patch: {
    automerge: true, // Auto-merge patch updates
    automergeType: "pr",
  },
  minor: {
    automerge: false, // Require manual review
  },
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Renovate not detecting my UV project?**
A: Ensure `uv.lock` exists in your repository root. Renovate auto-detects UV projects by this file.

**Q: Too many PRs being created?**
A: Adjust `prConcurrentLimit` and `prHourlyLimit` in the configuration.

**Q: Want to test before full migration?**
A: Start with Renovate alongside Dependabot, then disable Dependabot once comfortable.

### Rollback Plan

If needed, you can always:

1. Disable Renovate app
2. Re-enable Dependabot
3. Restore the sync workflow

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these improvements after migration:

- **Reduced manual work**: No more sync workflow maintenance
- **Faster security updates**: Hours vs. days for vulnerability patches
- **Better PR organization**: Grouped updates reduce noise
- **Improved visibility**: Dependency dashboard provides overview
- **Enhanced security posture**: More comprehensive scanning

## 🎉 Conclusion

This migration to Renovate provides:

- **Native UV support** without workarounds
- **Advanced dependency management** features
- **Better security posture** with automated patches
- **Improved developer experience** with intelligent grouping
- **Future-proof solution** with leading-edge tooling support

The migration eliminates the need for `requirements.txt` workarounds and provides a more robust, feature-rich dependency management solution that's specifically designed for modern Python tooling like UV.
