# ADR-001: Python Version Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project needs to define a clear Python version support strategy that balances:

- Access to modern Python features
- Compatibility with common deployment environments
- Maintenance burden of supporting multiple versions
- Performance and security considerations

## Decision

We will support Python 3.10+ with the following strategy:

1. **Minimum Version**: Python 3.10
2. **Target Version**: Python 3.13 (latest stable)
3. **Testing Matrix**: Test against Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
4. **Development**: Use Python 3.13 for development
5. **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies support Python 3.10+

## Consequences

### Positive

- Access to modern Python features (pattern matching, improved type hints, performance improvements)
- Reduced maintenance burden compared to supporting older versions
- Better security posture with recent Python versions
- Improved performance from recent Python optimizations

### Negative

- May exclude users on older Python versions
- Some enterprise environments may be slower to adopt newer Python versions

### Neutral

- Need to maintain compatibility testing across supported versions
- Documentation must clearly state version requirements

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Python 3.8+**: Would provide broader compatibility but miss significant improvements in 3.9+
2. **Python 3.12+**: Would provide access to latest features but reduce compatibility
3. **Python 3.9+**: Considered but 3.10 provides significant improvements in pattern matching and type hints

## Implementation Notes

- Use `requires-python = ">=3.10"` in pyproject.toml
- Configure CI to test against all supported versions
- Use type hints and features available in Python 3.10+
- Document version requirements clearly in README and installation guide
