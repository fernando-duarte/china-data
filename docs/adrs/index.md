# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This section contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important architectural and design
decisions made during the development of the China Economic Data Analysis package.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made along
with their context and consequences. They help teams understand:

- **Why** certain decisions were made
- **What** alternatives were considered
- **When** the decision was made
- **Who** was involved in the decision
- **What** the consequences and trade-offs are

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes

## Current ADRs

| ADR                                       | Title                   | Status      | Date       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| [ADR-001](001-python-version-strategy.md) | Python Version Strategy | ✅ Accepted | 2025-01-27 |
| [ADR-002](002-type-checking-strategy.md)  | Type Checking Strategy  | ✅ Accepted | 2025-01-27 |
| [ADR-003](003-documentation-strategy.md)  | Documentation Strategy  | ✅ Accepted | 2025-01-27 |

## Decision Categories

### Infrastructure Decisions

- Python version requirements and compatibility
- Dependency management and security
- CI/CD pipeline architecture

### Code Quality Decisions

- Type checking and static analysis
- Testing strategies and coverage
- Code formatting and linting

### Documentation Decisions

- Documentation tooling and format
- API documentation generation
- User guide structure

## Contributing ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Create a new ADR** using the template below
2. **Discuss with the team** before finalizing
3. **Update the index** with the new ADR
4. **Reference the ADR** in relevant code or documentation

### ADR Template
